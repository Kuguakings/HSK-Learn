# 📂 Project Architecture (For Developers)

### 1. ☁️ Tencent Cloud Bridge (The Core)
This project uses a hybrid architecture. The C# code cannot talk to the cloud directly; it must go through a bridge.

* **The Bridge File:** `Assets/Plugins/WebGL/TcbWebGL`
    * **What is it?** This is the **ONLY** place where C# can communicate with the Tencent Cloud SDK (JavaScript).
    * **How to dev:** If you need to add a new cloud function (e.g., "Upload Score"), you must define the JS function here first, then call it from C#.

* **The Web Template:** `Assets/WebGLTemplates/TcbTemplate`
    * Contains `cloudbase` SDK initialization and `index.html`.

### 2. Standard Folders
* **`Assets/Scripts/`**: Game Logic (C#).
* **`Assets/Resources/`**: Data files for HSK Levels.
* **`Assets/Scenes/`**: Game scene.

# 🛠️ Setup Guide (Strict Requirements)

### 1. Unity Editor Version (Crucial!)
My project is built on the specific version: **`2022.3.62f1c1`**.

**Please follow this priority to download Unity:**

* **🥇 Priority 1 (Best Match):**
    Search for **`2022.3.62f1c1`** in your Unity Hub. If you can find it, **download this one**. It matches my environment 100%.

* **🥈 Priority 2 (Fallback):**
    If you **cannot** find the `c1` version (because you are outside China), please download **`2022.3.62f1`** instead.
    * *Note:* It is compatible. If Unity warns about a version change when opening, just click **"Continue"**.

### 2. Cloning (LFS Warning)
**⛔ Do NOT use "Download ZIP".**
* This repository uses **Git LFS** for textures.
* Please use `git clone`.
* *Check:* If your project folder is small (MBs), run `git lfs pull`.

### 3. How to Start
The default view will be empty.
**👉 You must manually load the scene:**
1.  Go to `Assets` -> `Scenes`.
2.  Double-click the main scene file.

# 🛠️ Development & Deployment (Strict Workflow)

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: How to Build (Clean Build)
To prevent errors and "ghost files", please follow this specific workflow when updating the game:

1.  **🧹 CLEAN FIRST (Crucial Step):**
    Before clicking "Build", open your project folder and **DELETE all files inside the `docs/` folder**.
    (请务必先手动删除 `docs` 文件夹内的所有内容，确保空文件夹状态。)

2.  **🏗️ Build:**
    * In Unity, go to `File` -> `Build Settings`.
    * Click **Build**.
    * Select the empty **`docs`** folder.

3.  **🚀 Push to Update:**
    * Git will detect deleted old files and added new files.
    * Commit & Push.
    * Netlify will auto-deploy the new version.

Let's make a great game! 🚀
