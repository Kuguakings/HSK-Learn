# 📂 Project Architecture (Read this before Coding)

### 1. Core Folders
* **`Assets/Scripts/`**: This is where most of the C# game logic resides.
* **`Assets/Scenes/`**: Contains the game levels. Please load the Main scene to start.
* **`Assets/Resources/`**: Contains game data for different HSK levels (`HSK1` - `HSK4`).
* **`Assets/Sprites/`**: Contains 2D UI images and assets.

### 2. ☁️ Tencent Cloud Integration (Important!)
We use **Tencent Cloud Base (TCB)** for our backend data. The communication between Unity (C#) and the Cloud (JavaScript) happens in these specific folders:

**A. The Bridge (Interface)**
* **Location:** `Assets/Plugins/WebGL/TcbWebGL`
* **Function:** This is the critical **interface file** (usually a `.jslib`). It acts as a bridge, allowing Unity's C# code to call JavaScript functions to send/receive data from Tencent Cloud.
* *If you need to add new API calls, check this file.*

**B. The Web Template**
* **Location:** `Assets/WebGLTemplates/TcbTemplate`
* **Function:** This is the custom HTML template for the game.
    * `cloudbase...js`: Handles the initialization of the Tencent Cloud SDK.
    * `index.html`: The entry point of the web page.

# 🛠️ Developer Setup Guide

### 1. Unity Version Requirement
**⚠️ Important:** Please make sure you are using **Unity [2022.3.10f1]** (or the exact version match).
* *Version mismatches will likely break the scene files.*

### 2. Cloning (LFS Warning)
**⛔ Do NOT use "Download ZIP".**
* This repository relies heavily on **Git LFS** for textures and models.
* Please use `git clone` (via Terminal or GitHub Desktop).
* *Check:* After cloning, if your total folder size is small (MBs instead of GBs), `git lfs pull` might be needed.

### 3. How to Load the Level
When you first open the project in Unity, the viewport will look **empty/blue**. This is normal.

**👉 You must manually load the scene:**
1.  Go to the **Project Panel** at the bottom.
2.  Navigate to: `Assets` -> `Scenes`.
3.  Double-click the main scene file.

### 4. Workflow Notes
* **Syncing:** Please pull the latest changes before starting your work to avoid binary merge conflicts.

Let's make a great game! 🚀
